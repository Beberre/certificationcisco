In particular, the port with lowest cost to the root bridge will become root port (on non-root switch). '),(6,'Explanation: The IEEE 802.1 Q protocol interconnects VLANs between multiple switches, routers, and servers. With 802.1 Q, a network administrator can define a VLAN topology to span multiple physical devices. '),(7,'Explanation:  STP(802.1d) is used to prevent Layer 2 loops. 802.1 q is a Frame Relay protocol which belongs to VLAN.

VLANs 1002-1005 are default VLANs for FDDI & Token Ring and they cannot be deleted or used for Ethernet. '),(15,'Explanation: RSTP and STP operate on switches and are based on the exchange of Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) between switches. RSTP operates at Layer 2 and that is Data Link layer. '),(16,'Explanation: When a frame is received, the switch looks at the destination hardware address and finds the interface if it is in its MAC address table.

We also need to assign an area to this process. '),(34,'Explanation: The default maximum number of equal-cost paths that can be placed into the routing table of a Cisco OSPF router is 8. '),(35,'Explanation: The Feasible Successor is a backup route to a destination that is kept in the Topology Table. '),(36,'Explanation: The Process ID for OSPF on a router is only locally significant and you can use the same number on each router, or each router can have a different number-it just does not matter. The numbers you can use are from 1 to 65,535.

They are used as the first 24 bits of the MAC address to uniquely identify a particul'),(45,'Explanation: IPv6 addresses are classified by the primary addressing and routing methodologies common in networking: unicast addressing, anycast addressing, and multicast addressing. '),(46,'Explanation: A single interface maybe assigned multiple addresses of any type (unicast, anycast, multicast). Every IPv6-enabled interface must contain at least one loopback and one link-local address.  '),(47,'Explanation: Private RFC 1918 IP addresses are meant to be used by organizations locally within their own network only, and cannot be used globally for internet use. '),(48,'Explanation: Here are some of the benefits of hierarchical addressing:  *	Reduced number of routing table entries-Whether it is with your internet routers or your internal routers, you should try to keep your routing tables as small as possible by using r'),(49,'Explanation: There are two ways that an IPv6 address can be additionally compressed: compressing leading zeros and substituting a group of consecutive zeros with a single double colon(::). Both of these can be used in any number of combinations to notate '),(50,'Explanation:  Below is the list of common kinds of IPv6 addresses: '),(51,'Explanation: IPv6 does not use broadcasts, and auto-configuration is a feature of IPV6  that allows for hosts to automatically obtain anIPv6 address.

The authentication process is done by the router or a central access server such as a TACACS+ or RADIUS server.  '),(73,'Explanation: DHCP works in a client/server mode and operates like any other client/server relationship. When a PC connects to a DHCP server, the server assigns or leases an IP address to that PC. The PC connects to the network with that leased IP address '),(74,'Explanation: An address conflict occurs when two hosts use the same IP address. During address assignment, DHCP checks for conflicts using ping and gratuitous ARP. If a conflict is detected, the address is removed from the pool. The address will not be as'),(75,'Explanation: With CHAP authentication, the configured passwords must be identical on each router. Here, it is configured as litle123 on one side and big123 on the other. '),(76,'Explanation: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol used to configure devices that are connected to a network (known as hosts) so they can communicate on that network using the Internet Protocol (IP). It involves clients and '),(77,'Explanation: Network or subnetwork IP address (for example 11.0.0.0/8 or 13.1.0.0/16) and broadcast address (for example 23.2.1.255/24) should never be assignable to hosts. When trying to assign these addresses to hosts, you will receive an error message '),(78,'Explanation: Static NAT is to map a single outside IP address to a single inside IP address. This is typically done to allow incoming connections from the outside (internet) to the inside. Since these are static, they are always present in the NAT table e'),(79,'Explanation: With HSRP, two or more devices support a virtual router with a fictitious MAC address and unique IP address. There are two versions of HSRP. + With HSRP version 1, the virtual router\'s MAC address is 0000. 0c07.ACxx, in which xx is the HSRP g'),(80,'Explanation: One disadvantage of HSRP and VRRP is that only one router is in use, other routers must wait for the primary to fail because they can be used. However, Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) can use up to four routers simultaneously. In GLBP,'),(81,'Explanation: Object tracking is the process of tracking the state of a configured object and uses that state to determine the priority of the VRRP router in a VRRP group. '),(82,'Explanation: The virtual MAC address of HSRP version 1 is 0000.0C07.ACxx, where xx is the HSRP group number in hexadecimal based on the respective interface. For example, HSRP group 10 uses the HSRP virtual MAC address of 0000.0C07.AC0A. HSRP version 2 us'),(83,'Explanation: The Syslog sender sends a small (less than 1KB) text message to the Syslog receiver. The Syslog receiver is commonly called syslogd, Syslog daemon, or Syslog server. Syslog messages can be sent via UDP (port 514) and/or TCP (typically, port 5'),(84,'Explanation: The Message Logging is divided into 8 levels as listed below: Level Keyword Description 0 emergencies System is unusable 1 alerts Immediate action is needed 2 critical Critical conditions exist 3 errors Error conditions exist 4 warnings Warni'),(85,'Explanation: By default, Cisco IOS devices, CatOS switches, and VPN 3000 Concentrators use facility local7 while Cisco PIX Firewalls use local4 to send syslog messages.

Traps are messages alerting the SNMP manager to a condition on the network. Traps can mean improper user authentication, restarts, link status (up or down), MAC address tracking, closing of '),(90,'Explanation: Cisco IOS software supports the following versions of SNMP: SNMPv1 - The Simple Network Management Protocol: A Full Internet Standard, defined in RFC 1157 (RFC 1157 replaces the earlier versions that were published as RFC 1067 and RFC 1098). '),(91,'Explanation: SNMPv1/v2 can neither authenticate the source of a management message nor provide encryption. Without authentication, it is possible for nonauthorized users to exercise SNMP network management functions. It is also possible for nonauthorized '),(92,'Explanation: SNMP is an application-layer protocol that provides a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents. SNMP provides a standardized framework and a common language used for the monitoring and management of devices in a netwo'),(93,'Explanation: By default, switches send the output from system messages and debug privileged EXEC commands to a logging process.

Other group members provide backup for the AVG in the event that the AVG becomes unavailable. The AVG assigns a virtual MAC address to each membe'),(98,'Explanation: Follow these guidelines when configuring port security: *	Port security can only be configured on static access ports, trunk ports, or 802.1Q tunnel ports *	A secure port cannot be a dynamic access port *	A secure port cannot be a destination'),(99,'Explanation: From the output, we can see that port security is disabled so this needs to be enabled. Also, the maximum number of devices is set to 2; this needs to be just one if we want the single host to have access and nothing else. '),(100,'Explanation: This question is to examine the layer 2 security configuration. In order to satisfy the requirements of this question, you should perform the following configurations in the interface mode: First, configure the interface mode as the access mo'),(101,'Explanation: By using this command, all the (current and future) passwords are encrypted. This command is primarily useful for keeping unauthorized individuals from viewing your password in your configuration file. '),(102,'Explanation: Routers go line by line through an access list until a match is found and then will not look any further, even if a more specific of better match is found later on in the access list. So, it best to begin with the most specific entries first,'),(103,'Explanation: The ip access-group is used to apply and ACL to an interface. From the output shown, we know that the ACL is applied to outbound traffic, so no ip access-group 102 out will remove the effect of this ACL. '),(104,'Explanation: We only enable PortFast feature on access ports (ports connected to end stations). But if someone does not know, they can accidentally plug that port to another switch and a loop may occur when BPDUs are being transmitted and received on thes'),(105,'Explanation: show ip interface command shows the interfaces affected by the ACL. '),(106,'Explanation: The login keyword has been set, but not password. This will result in the password required, but none set message to users trying to telnet to this router. '),(107,'Explanation: We can have only 1 access list per protocol, per direction and per interface. This means: *	We cannot have 2 inbound access lists on an interface *	We can have 1 inbound and 1 outbound access list on an interface '),(108,'Explanation: The standard access lists are ranged from 1 to 99 and from 1300 to 1999 so only access list 50 is a standard access list. '),(109,'Explanation: access-list 10 permit ip 192.168.146.0 0.0.1.255 would allow only the 192.168.146.0 and 192.168.147.0 networks, and access-list 10 permit ip 192.168.148.0 0.0.1.255 would allow only the 192.168.148.0 and 192.168.149.0 networks. '),(110,'Explanation: It is a waste to administratively shut down the interface. Moreover, someone can still access the virtual terminal interfaces via other interfaces -> We cannot physically secure a virtual interface because it is virtual ->. To apply an access'),(111,'Explanation: We can verify whether port security has been configured by using the show running-config or show port-security interface for more detail. An example of the output of show port-security interface command is shown below: '),(112,'Explanation: The configuration shown here is an example of port security, specifically port security using sticky addresses. You can use port security with dynamically learned and static MAC addresses to restrict a port\'s ingress traffic by limiting the M'),(113,'Explanation: In the interface configuration mode, the command switchport port-security mac-address sticky enables sticky learning. When entering this command, the interface converts all the dynamic secure MAC addresses to sticky secure MAC addresses. '),(114,'Explanation: Host1 tries to communicate with Host2. The message destination host unreachable from Router1 indicates that the problem occurs when the data is forwarded from Host1 to Host2. According to the topology, we can infer that the link between Route'),(115,'Explanation: From the output, we can see that there is a problem with the Serial 0/0 interface. It is enabled, but the line protocol is down. There could be a result of mismatched encapsulation or the interface not receiving a clock signal from the CSU/DS'),(116,'Explanation: The command ping uses ICMP protocol, which is a network layer protocol used to propagate control message between host and router. The command ping is often used to verify the network connectivity, so it works at the network layer. '),(117,'Explanation: The ports on the switch are not up indicating it is a layer 1 (physical) problem so we should check cable type, power and how they are plugged in. '),(118,'Explanation: The switch 1 is configured with two VLANs: VLAN1 and VLAN2. The IP information of member Host A in VLAN1 is as follows: Address: 10.1.1.126 Mask: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: 10.1.1.254 The IP information of member Host B in VLAN2 is as follows: Ad'),(119,'Explanation: Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) is a Layer 2 protocol that utilizes a special-purpose algorithm to discover physical loops in a network and effect a logical loop-free topology.

Tracert, ipconfig, and winipcfg are PC commands, not IOS. '),(122,'Explanation: In OSPF, the hello and dead intervals must match and here we can see the hello interval is set to 5 on R1 and 10 on R2. The dead interval is also set to 20 on R1 but it is 40 on R2. '),(123,'Explanation: If we connect two switches via 2 or more links and do not enable STP on these switches then a loop (which creates multiple copies of the same unicast frame) will occur. It is an example of an improperly implemented redundant topology.
